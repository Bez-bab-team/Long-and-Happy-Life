 POLITICS_BAKOV_DESC:0 "§YBiography:§! Anton Bakov have been called many things – a successful entrepreneur, an eccentric billionaire, even a crazy man. But to himself, Bakov was always just a servant. A proud and loyal servant of the Russian monarchy, even though his masters have already been gone for more than one hundred years. \n\nWhen the national-bolsheviks took power in 1996, Bakov feared that the new pseudo-communist regime would forever ruin the chances of a renewed Russian Empire, however he quickly realized, that the new rulers of Russia were much closer to the former Tsars, than the fallen marxist overlords. From that point on, Bakov put his plan into motion, carefully building up loyalty with the new government with generous monetary investments and political moves. When the NBP began their gargantuan project of refolding Siberia into the center of Eurasian civilization, the billionaire was fairly acquainted with most of the higher echelon of the new government. Hence, when Bakov offered his services in building a giant high-tec city in the middle of Siberia to Egor Letov, the latter eagerly gave his permission. He didn’t pay much attention to the billionaire’s request about making the city a «monument to Russian monarchism», brushing it off as a whim of an eager individual. In record time, the old town of Kemerovo was razed to the ground, and on its place emerged Saint-Nicholas - a technological marvel and a monarchist paradise. \n\nAnd yet, Bakov was still unhappy. Every empire requires a ruler, and with the most advanced technologies of Eurasia in his hands, the mad billionaire proceeded with his most ambitious project yet – a powerful A.I in the likeness of Anastasia Romanova, that would be able to control all systems in the smart city he created. And while the A.I. ultimately lacked sentience, it became the biggest attraction of the Saint-Nicholas as well as Bakov’s greatest pride. The tremendous beacon of Russian monarchism stood proud in the depths of Eurasian heartland. \n\nHowever, nothing can last forever, and soon enough, the Eurasian civil war left Saint-Nicholas isolated. But for Anton Bakov this might be just another opportunity. The billionaire arguably holds the most advanced technologies of Eurasia in his hands, as well as a fairly sizeable amount of manpower. This might be the moment, when the Russian monarchy would finally find its place among the great powers of the world, with Anton Bakov riding as its herald."
 POLITICS_NICHOLASIII_DESC:0 "§YBirth name:§!§W Karl Emich Nikolaus Friedrich Hermann Prince of Leiningen§! \n\n§YBiography:§! Karl Emich is no stranger to royalty. Being both the prince of Leiningen and a claimant to the throne of the Russian Empire, the sixty-eight-year-old man was considered an important actor in discussions concerning various branches of royal houses. However, up until this point he has never been an actual ruler of a country. \n\nAfter Anton Bakov abandoned the fruitless attempts to breath life into an empty metallic husk, that is Anastasia, the mad billionaire finally decided that only a real Romanov is worth to lead the New Russian Empire forward. Thus, after being converted into orthodoxy, Karl Emich – grandson of Duchess Maria Kirillovna, became Nicholas III – the emperor of Russia and all of its people. \n\nAnd while the great city of Saint-Nicholas is still surrounded by enemies and traitors alike, with the help of Bakov’s technology and Nicholas’s willpower, the Russian Imperial flag would soon wave proud over all cities of the former Eurasia."
