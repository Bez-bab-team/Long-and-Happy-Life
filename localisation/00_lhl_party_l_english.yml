 POLITICS_BARKASHOW_DESC:0 "§YBiography:§! §WAleksandr Petrovich Barkashov was born in an unremarkable working-class family near Moscow in 1953. He spent significant part of his youth in the army (which left an indelible imprint on his personality), later worked as a locksmith (without much success), taught karate and learned blacksmithing.\n\nIn 1990, together with the former supporters of «Pamyat'» society, Barkashov created the right-wing radical organization Russian National Unity, which would later take a side with the Communists in the 1993 coup.\n\nThe RNU reached its greatest success between 1993 and 1996. The Unity ranks included thousands of retired military men, so his militants, who had filled the streets at that time, started posing a real threat to the Jel'tsin regime. However, with the advent of the National Bolsheviks, the Barkashov movement lost credibility and fell into the margins of political life.\n\nThe crisis years of Medvedev’s reign give a new birth to RNU with numerous young nationalists joining the organization. During the chaos of the civil war first days, Barkashev’s militants took control of the number of cities in Northern Russia, but Aleksandr himself no longer had former influence on his stormtroopers, and so he was forced to share power with a number of young and ambitious leaders.§!"
 POLITICS_RPR_KARA_MURZA_DESC:0 "§YBiography:§! §WOver his long life, Sergej Georgievich Kara-Murza, born back in 1931, managed to change more than one specialty and more than one vocation. Having begun his career as a chemist (achieved significant success on the field of this science), in 1968 he abruptly goes down in history and later becomes a member of the commission of experts of the Central Committee of the CPSU on the organization of science.\n\nDuring the rule of the Jel’tsin criminal regime, Kara-Murza continued to work in the government bodies. With the establishment of Jegor Letov’s administration, Sergej Georgievich became a member of the National Bolshevik Party, where he became a prominent representative of the left-patriotic wing.\n\nKara-Murza is a zealous advocate of the ideals of collectivism, the "traditional" ideocratic society and rational thinking. On the whole, he has a positive attitude to the historical experience of the USSR, criticizing Marxism from positions close to Antonio Gramsci and Folkism. Respectfully refers to religion, he speaks rather warmly about Orthodoxy.\n\nWith the collapse of the Eurasian Union, Kara-Murza headed the Penza Provisional Government of Russia (also known as «Land and Liberty Movement»), formed by left-wing National Bolsheviks and representatives of the People’s Patriotic Union «Rodina».§!"
