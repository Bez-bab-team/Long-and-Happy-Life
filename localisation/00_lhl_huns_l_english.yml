 POLITICS_CHS_STANJAL_DESC:"§YBirth name:§! §WVitalij Nikitin§!\n\n§YBiography:§! §WVitalij Nikitin was born on January 1, 1940, in the midst of a paranoid war-ready Soviet Union. Growing up in the Chuvash Autonomous Republic, Nikitin was a young man eager to study Social Science and Literature. During the following years under the Union, he lead a fairly unremarkable life in academia, but all changed upon the collapse of the Soviets.\n\nAs the Union dissolved, and nationalism burst out across the little nation, Nikitin headed the movement to restore the lost Chuvash identity.\n\nSuch activities naturally made him an enemy of an intolerant and authoritarian national-Bolshevik regime, and in 2008 Vitalij was ostracized and arrested under the pretext of "anti-popular propaganda." Having been betrayed by his nation and isolated from his people, Nikitin spent many years pondering the condition of his people, seeing them as similarly imprisoned by modern society and the Orthodox hegemony.\n\nDuring his long prison stay, Nikitin created a pseudoscientific theory, proclaiming the Chuvash people as direct heirs of the ancient people of the Huns, whose spirit of the conquerors was destroyed by the Zionist propaganda of Orthodox Christians.\n\nFortunately for him, the Russian government experienced severe turmoil and in 2015 Nikitin was freed from prison. Immediately after that, Nikitin seized the opportunity presented by the weak Russia, rallying like-minded nationalists under his iron fist. As the central government collapsed, the terrorist movement came to power in the region, declaring an independent Chuvash nation.\n\nAs last hope of the Chuvashia, Nikitin (Changing his name to Uldin Stan'jal) faces a myriad of problems, from low legitimacy on a global stage to holding an under-industrialized territory. However, by the grit of his spirit and the power of his will, Chuvash will not rest until all know the power of the true Huns.§!"
