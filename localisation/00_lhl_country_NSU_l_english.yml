 test.1.d:0 "The Progress Department, created on the personal initiative of the leader, worked for only a few days, but has already managed to make several outstanding discoveries! The persistent work of the dedicated scientists and engineers of our socialist homeland breathed new life into the Lamarckism and the Japhetic theory. Unlimited resources, freedom of thoughts and party consciousness will allow motherland’s science to unleash the potential of teachings undeservedly ruined by the philistinism of the bourgeois mind.\n\nNevertheless, despite the obvious goodness of its endeavors, the Progress Department was attacked by the Anti-Pseudoscience Commission, a scientific coordination organization that in the past supplied the Soviet government with information about unconscious or even counter-revolutionary elements in the ranks of the Soviet intellectuals. According to the leader of the Commission, an outstanding biologist and publicist Alexander Panchin, the Department “P” conducts pseudoscientific research in the fields of parapsychology, ufology and cryptozoology, thus betraying the ideals of rationalism and the scientific method.\n\nSuch short-sightedness and limited thinking are unacceptable to a Soviet scientist, and they show him as a chaldean and a charlatan in science, which, however, does not prevent Panchin from making mess in scientific circles through contacts in the Emergency Committee."

 POLITICS_PUCHKOV_DESC:0 "§YPseudonym:§! §WGoblin§!\n\n§YBiography:§! §WDmitrij Puchkov always believed in the  communist dream. He protected it, during his stay in the Soviet military and helped it expand while being stationed in DPRK. Even after the Union’s collapse Puchkov continued the fight in the police force, trying to keep the order in the murderous chaos of the 90’s. Rampant banditism, predatory privatizations and widespread poverty - capitalism has shown its rotten core, and Dmitrij never forgot that.\n\nThe rise of Letov and the national-Bolshevik party, gave him an opportunity. After joining the Rosgvardia in 2014, Puchkov used his connections from police service to form the “Dead End” a proto-party of radical left-wing activists, aiming at the restoration of the USSR. Slowly but surely he moved up the ranks, until he became the leader of the Saint-Petersburg guard. There, he waited, plotting for years and waiting for a spark, to light the fires of a new revolution.\n\nLetov’s death was to be that spark. Taking advantage of his influence in the Rosgvardia, Puchkov seized Saint-Petersburg and the neighboring  areas. Thousands flocked to the reclaimed Leningrad, cheering for the return of their Soviet motherland. §!"
