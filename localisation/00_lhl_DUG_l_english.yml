 POLITICS_PHILOSOPHER_KING_DESC:0 "§YBirth name:§!§W Unknown§!\n\n§YLore:§!§W And so, at the head stands the Philosopher King, who, accordingly, represents a being with no personality of its own. The Philosopher King, a philosophical Tsar, is essentially no different from the embodiment of this personal Angel. The king is both an Angel and the whole people. He is a true person, superior to both the individual and the collective or society. \n\nThe Philosopher King must be hidden. Moreover, his existence must be so intense that it transcends the limits of existence. He will act in not-acting (the Taoist ideal of the perfect ruler is he who performs inaction, or Wu-Wei). Considering his deep and profound connection to the apophatic, he will be inexistent in existing or, on the contrary, he will exist in not existing. The Philosopher King is as if he was not, and he is not as he is. He should be easy, transparent, always open to the abyss represented by him in the Tcardom. Perhaps he will communicate with his subjects from behind a curtain, from the depths of a cave, or even through an oracle. He should neither speak nor be silent, but instead only give signs. The Philosopher King operates with subtle signs, in semi-silence and soft regal whisper, as the meaning is transmitted as directly as the spirit blows.\n\n He is absolutely transparent, devoid of any individual properties. The personal in him should be so minute that it would be preferable to conceal everything reminiscent of it, including his body and his image. It would be better if no one could see the Philosopher King as something external. All should recognize him as an internal ruler, as the “guest within.”§!"
 POLITICS_DUGIN_DESC:0 "§YBiography:§! §WTo be a revolutionary, he lacked the character of one. A book person with little to no real life experience, Aleksandr Gelyevich was born in 1962 in Moscow and has left the city for only a few times. His mother a professor and his father a colonel, he’s been among the privileged from the very beginning of his life. His whims and talents have even caused him to spend a while in a mental hospital. For some time, he used to be a singer-songwriter…\n\nCalled by his ill-wishers nothing short of a 'Demonic Genius', Aleksandr Gelyevich Dugin is a pure manifestation of the National Bolshevik Party's erratic soul, torn between the two equally important goals of shocking the common folk and creating an utopia. \n\nAmong Aleksandr Gelyevich’s numerous successes are the peaceful reunification of Russia with some post-Soviet countries as well as signing a Pact of Amity with Germany, with the latter putting an end to the Anglo-Atlanticist world hegemony.\n\nHowever, this triumph was followed, unexpectedly for all, by Dugin’s isolation. It isn’t entirely clear whether it was caused by Yegor Letov losing all confidence in his long-time comrade or Dugin himself getting disappointed with National Bolshevism.\n\nLater on Dugin formed the 'Katechon' faction within the NBP. It was to stay away from the numerous conflicts plaguing the movement and dedicate itself to nothing but abstract philosophical undertakings with no care for any practical application. \n\nIn light of the recently sprung succession crisis, numerous NBP members have looked up to the long-forgotten patriarch, hoping he might manage to protect the revolution’s conquests.§!"
 POLITICS_SVETOV_DESC:0 "§YBiography:§! §WMany find Mikhail Svetov to have more of a rock star than of a statesman. This impression is based not all that much on his bright looks or his extravagant manner of speech giving, but on his very fashion of turning politics into a show.\n\nHaving grown up in a family of classical liberals, Mikhail has long abandoned his parents’ political views and entered the NBP at a young age. The reasoning behind this decision had nothing to do with the utopian promises and revanchist rhetoric, but the energy, wildness and the spirit of uncompromising protest integral to the Nazbols of the age.\n\nAs the NBP became a stagnant, cumbersome Leviathan plagued by corruption and apathy, Mikhail refused to accept this way of things and joined one of the many discussion clubs founded by young Nazbol radicals taking interest in fringe political ideas. \n\nHis oratory brilliance and charisma allowed him to quickly overshadow all the other leadership candidates, making him the hero in the eyes of the protesting youth. And while all the pompous bigwigs and haughty party players were busy with squabbling and quarreling among themselves, a new movement was already steadily rising up in the party’s grassroots. A movement enamoured with the ideas of Hans Hermann Hoppe, freedom of association, and non-aggression principle.\n\nNeedless to say, the Ivanovo party committee’s refusal to recognize the NBP’s High Council as a legitimate authority took them all by fairly unpleasant surprise.§!"
 POLITICS_STERLIGOV_DESC:0 "§YBiography:§! §WTrying to enumerate all the events and projects German Sterligov was more or less responsible for would inevitably produce a truly tremendous list. Over the course of his life, he owned around ten law firms, spent a while as a mortician, dabbled in political activism and even was, for some time, the head of a Gentry Assembly.\n\nGerman L’vovich has tried to persuade the NBP’s Council to shift to a gold standard, started the world’s first cryptocurrency exchange and even founded a private military company tasked with asymmetric warfare against Eduard Limonov’s allies in Africa.\n\nEvery single one of those undertakings turned out a failure. Sterligov is a hopeless enthusiast whose numerous endeavors are motivated by his insatiable passion for exploring new horizons, not by profit-seeking or cravings for glory. He’s a man fishing in uncharted waters, and the anarchy that swept Eurasia is, as far as he’s concerned, not a catastrophe but a chance.§!"
