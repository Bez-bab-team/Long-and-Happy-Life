 POLITICS_LOUIS_CACHET_DESC:0 "§YBirth name:§! §WKristian Vikernes.§!\n\n§YBiography:§! §WKristian Vikerness was born on February 11, 1973 in the Norwegian city of Bergen. At the age of fourteen, the young man became part of the neo-Nazi organization «The Black Circle of Norway», which aimed to cleanse the country from Kristian influence.\n\nIn 1993, due to rivalry within the group and struggle within the organization, Kristian kills his ally Øystein Aarseth, for which he will subsequently be sentenced to 21 years in prison. However, already in 1997, Kristian managed to escape from prison to Russia, where he would head the far-right organization, the Heathen’s Front.\n\nIn the mid 2000-th, Kristian, who changed his name to Louis Cachet, joined the private military company «Edelweiss», which, according to unconfirmed reports, was indirectly financed by the government of Jegor Letov. The courage and cruelty shown by Louis in operations in third world countries allowed him to occupy a leading position among mercenaries.\n\nThe dissemination of the marginal ideas of Cachet (which included elements of Nazi teachings, anarcho-primitivism and occultism) among mercenary groups did not cause Moscow’s fears because it did not want to interfere in their affairs as long as they cope with their duties.\n\nAfter the tragic death of Jegor Letov, and the subsequent secession of the Union State from Eurasia, Louis led the uprising of numerous PMCs in northern Russia.§!"
 POLITICS_DOBROSLAV_DESC:0 "§YBirth name:§! §WAleksej Dobrovol’skij§!\n\n§YBiography:§! §WAleksej Dobrovol’skij was born on October 13, 1938 in a proletarian family of convinced Stalinists. Young Dobrovol’skij grew up in the atmosphere of Stalin’s cult of personality, admired everything connected to him.\n\nIn 1956 he left Komsomol in protest against the campaign that had begun in the country to overcome the consequences of the Stalin personality cult. Later, he abandoned his communist views.\n\nAt the beginning of 1957, under the influence of the anti-communist uprising in Hungary, he created the Russian National Socialist Party with a group of friends, for which he would be sentenced to imprisonment in 1958, and later would be recognized as a mentally ill person. Subsequently, Dobrovol’skij will be imprisoned several more times because of his dissident activities.\n\nIn the late eighties, Alexej joined one of the first neopagan organizations in Russia and will change his name to Dobroslav. Later, he joined the Heathen’s Front of Louis Cachet, where he created a syncretic religious system with the combination of elements from Germanic paganism, Slavic mythology and Soviet folk religion.\n\nThanks to his acquaintance with Louis Cachet, Dobroslav freely preached his views among the semi-secret mercenary organizations of Eurasia, converting many soldiers of fortune into them. The religious system of Dobrovolsky includes the concept of the "Masonic conspiracy", technophobic motives and faith in the "Golden Age", for which Russia should be cleansed of the wicked.§!"
