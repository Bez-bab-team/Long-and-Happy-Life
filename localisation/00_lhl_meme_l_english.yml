Now the end of each episode is accompanied by a different song of late Yegor Letov - the former dictator of Eurasia.\n\nMany have speculated, that such drastic changes are the result of the recent occupation of Japanese Isles by the warlord clique of Natalia Poklonskaya and the formation of the "Russo-Japanese State", however the director himself claimed that all of the changes have been entirely his own doing, and were the result of "a long journey of self-discovery and self-improvement".\n\nIt remains to be seen, if the new series will be remembered just as fondly as the original or be forgotten in a few years, as a disgusting butchering of a well-known classic."
